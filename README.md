## Overview

The E-commerce Theme Builder is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that solves a critical problem for small and medium-sized e-commerce business owners: creating professional-looking online stores without technical skills or hiring developers.

The application provides a fully visual environment where building pages is as simple as assembling blocks. Users can:

- Build pages using a library of 13 predefined, responsive components
- Customize content through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Change global theme settings (colors, fonts) to match their brand
- Preview their store with mock product data before going live
- Manage multiple pages (Home, Catalog, Product, Contact) from a single workspace

### Target Users

Non-technical shop owners who need a simple, intuitive tool to independently manage their store's appearance and gain full control over their brand and customer experience.

### Key Highlights

- Visual drag-and-drop interface with vertical component stacking
- Component variants for flexible layouts (e.g., 1, 2, or 3-column text sections)
- Independent save mechanisms for page layouts and global theme settings
- Protection against losing unsaved changes with confirmation dialogs
- Live preview in the editor with separate Demo Store view for saved states
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
