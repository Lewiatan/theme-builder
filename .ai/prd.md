# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - E-commerce Theme Builder

## 1. Product Overview
The E-commerce Theme Builder is a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) application that allows non-technical shop owners to create and customize the appearance of their online store through a visual drag-and-drop interface. Users can build pages using a library of predefined, responsive components, customize their content, and change the global look and feel of the theme, such as colors and fonts.

The system consists of three separate applications:
- **Theme Builder**: A React-based visual editor where authenticated users design and customize their shop pages
- **Demo Shop**: A separate React Router v7 application where users can preview their published shop as customers would see it
- **Backend API**: A Symfony REST API that manages data persistence, authentication, and business logic

The primary goal of this project is to create a functional product MVP while also becoming the part for a future E-commerce SaaS platform. The application emphasizes intuitiveness and ease of use, enabling users to quickly achieve their desired results without writing any code.

## 2. User Problem
Many owners of small and medium-sized e-commerce businesses lack the technical skills or budget to hire developers to create or modify a professional-looking online store. Existing platforms can be too complex, limited in customization options, or require coding knowledge, which presents a barrier to entry. As a result, entrepreneurs spend too much time struggling with tools instead of focusing on growing their business.

The E-commerce Theme Builder solves this problem by offering a fully visual environment where building a page is like assembling blocks. The target user, the "non-technical shop owner," needs a tool that is simple, intuitive, and allows them to independently manage their store's appearance, giving them full control over their brand and customer experience.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. User Interface and Workspace
- The Theme Builder application is a React Single Page Application (SPA) consisting of four main sections:
  - Top Navigation Bar: Contains a page selection menu, an unsaved changes indicator, and action buttons (Reset, Save, Demo, Theme Settings).
  - Left Sidebar: A library of available components that can be dragged into the workspace.
  - Central Workspace (Canvas): The main area where the user arranges and edits components. It functions as a live preview.
  - Right Sidebar: A collapsible panel for managing global theme settings (colors, fonts).
- All data operations are performed via REST API calls to the backend.

### 3.2. Component System
- Users can build pages by dragging components from the left panel onto the workspace.
- Components can only be stacked vertically (one below another).
- Hovering over a component in the workspace reveals controls: a settings icon (cogwheel), a delete button, and drag handles.
- Components can have predefined variants (e.g., a text section with 1, 2, or 3 columns) that the user can select in its settings.
- Editing component content (text, images, links) is done in a modal window that opens after clicking the settings icon.

### 3.3. Editing Modals
- Changes made in the modal window are temporary and are not reflected live in the workspace.
- Changes are applied to the workspace only after clicking the "Apply" button.
- The "Cancel" button closes the modal, discarding all changes. If changes have been made, a confirmation prompt will appear.
- The modal cannot be closed by clicking the background to prevent accidental loss of changes.

### 3.4. Page Management
- Upon first registration, four pages are automatically created for the user: Home, Catalog, Product, and Contact.
- Each of these pages is pre-populated with a default component layout.
- The user can switch between pages using a dropdown menu in the top bar.

### 3.5. Theme Settings
- The user can modify global theme settings (color palette, font family) in the collapsible right sidebar.
- Changes to theme settings are immediately visible in the workspace.
- Saving theme settings is done independently of saving page changes, via a dedicated "Save" button in the panel.

### 3.6. Saving and Resetting
- Changes to the page layout and content are saved using the "Save" button in the top bar.
- The "Reset" button in the top bar discards unsaved page changes and restores the last saved state.
- The theme settings panel has a separate button to reset unsaved theme changes.
- All reset actions require user confirmation.
- If the workspace is empty (all components have been deleted), a "Restore Default Layout" button will appear.
- Restoring the layout works only for the currently edited page.

### 3.7. Unsaved Changes Protection
- If the user attempts to navigate away (e.g., by switching pages, logging out, closing the browser tab) with unsaved changes (to the page, theme, or both), a dialog box will appear with a warning and options to "Stay" or "Leave without saving."

### 3.8. Preview (Demo Store)
- The "Demo" button opens a separate application (Demo Shop) in a new tab, which renders only the saved state of the pages and theme.
- The Demo Shop is a standalone React Router v7 application, completely separate from the Theme Builder.
- The Demo Shop fetches saved theme/page data and mock products from the backend API.
- Mock product catalog is stored in the database and accessed via REST API endpoints.

### 3.9. Authentication
- The system requires user registration and login via JWT-based authentication.
- Authentication is handled by the backend API (Symfony with LexikJWTAuthenticationBundle).
- Each user has access only to their own templates and data.
- Theme Builder requires authentication; Demo Shop is publicly accessible (read-only).

### 3.10. Image Handling
- In the MVP, there is no central media library. The user must upload images individually for each component that requires one.
- Images are uploaded via the backend API to Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible storage).
- The API validates user permissions and file types before storing images.
